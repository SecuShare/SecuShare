# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

SecuShare currently supports security fixes on the latest `main` branch state.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not report security vulnerabilities in public GitHub issues.

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting:

1. Open the repository **Security** tab
2. Click **Report a vulnerability**
3. Submit reproduction details, impact, and any suggested mitigation

If you cannot access the Security tab, contact the maintainers through a private GitHub security advisory draft.

## What to Include

- Affected component and version/commit
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Impact assessment (confidentiality/integrity/availability)
- Suggested fix (if available)
